### **Problem**
In high school and university education, grading is a time-consuming, subjective, and inconsistent process for teachers. Personalised feedback—critical for student development—is often too generic, leaving students without clear guidance on how to improve. Teachers, stretched thin with increasing student populations, can no longer provide the necessary one-on-one attention to every learner. With ongoing shortages of qualified educators, especially in the UK, there is a need for a scalable, effective solution that addresses these pain points while empowering students to learn at their own pace. This challenge is exacerbated by the growing importance of data-driven decision-making in educational outcomes.

### **How I Would Use AI**
Our AI-powered solution would streamline and optimise grading and feedback by automating the process based on curriculum standards and grading rubrics, providing personalised, actionable insights for each student. The AI system would evaluate submissions not just for correctness, but for quality, creativity, and understanding. It would then generate specific feedback, including areas of improvement and personalised suggestions for better performance. Importantly, the AI would allow for an interactive learning experience, where students can engage with it to ask questions, request clarifications, and deeply understand the reasoning behind each correction.
Beyond grading, the AI would offer Agentic AI components that proactively track student progress, identify knowledge gaps, and recommend personalized exercises or resources. It would also set individual learning goals and track them over time to ensure consistent progress. For teachers, the AI would analyze class-wide performance to generate customized lesson plans, ensuring they focus on the areas most needed, backed by data insights. The AI would automatically suggest adjustments to teaching strategies, content, and activities based on real-time student performance, allowing teachers to deliver more efficient and effective lessons.

Additionally, teachers would receive comprehensive, data-driven insights into student progress, identifying trends, strengths, and areas requiring intervention. This feedback loop would empower teachers to focus on the most critical needs and offer targeted support, without being bogged down by manual grading.
- Key capabilities include:
- Tailored 1:1 Lesson Plans: For individual students, the AI would generate specific lesson plans based on their current progress, learning gaps, and goals. These plans would include exercises, content, and guidance for teachers to provide personalised instruction during 1:1 sessions.
- Classroom Lesson Plans: After analysing class-wide data, the AI could create a post-assignment, end-of-module review session for teachers, recommending which areas the entire class struggled with and which content needs more reinforcement. This would allow the teacher to focus on common pain points and improve overall class performance.

Actionable Insights: The AI would provide data-backed insights to teachers on which students may need more individualised support and which teaching strategies or activities were most effective, enhancing their ability to adjust teaching methods and better engage students.

Real-time Adjustments: During ongoing lessons, the AI could suggest quick adjustments, such as changes to exercises or providing additional resources to a student or group in need, ensuring that teaching time is spent effectively.
### **Technical Details on How AI Works**
- **Generative AI:** The core AI would use Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) models to assess student submissions, offering suggestions and corrections. It would be tuned to understand different subjects, curriculum standards, and grading rubrics. This enables highly personalised feedback for each student.
- **Agentic AI:** The system would also include agentic AI, allowing the AI to autonomously engage with students in a goal-oriented manner. The AI wouldn't just respond reactively but would track a student's progress, proactively suggest targeted learning activities, and make decisions about when and how to adjust the learning path. This includes:
  - Autonomous Scheduling: Seamlessly manage appointments between students and teachers, reducing friction in booking sessions and improving accessibility. By integration with other tools the system could integrate with calendar APIs for automated booking of extra help sessions with teachers and synchronize with school management systems for seamless implementation.
  - Proactive Learning Path Creation: Customising the learning journey over time by adapting to a student's evolving needs, ensuring ongoing support in areas that need attention, maximising engagement and effectiveness.
  - In-Context Assistance: Offer real-time hints, guidance, and support for students working on assignments, homework, or practice tasks.
  - Sentiment Analysis: Gauge emotional states and adjust interactions to maintain engagement, motivation, and focus.
  - Peer Learning: Match students with peers who are working on similar concepts or tasks for collaborative learning.
  - Automated Teacher Reporting: Provide teachers with real-time, actionable insights into student progress, strengths, and areas needing improvement.
  - Content Generation: Automatically create quizzes, exercises, and custom learning materials aligned with the curriculum.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): ** The AI would be powered by a knowledge base that integrates curriculum standards, textbooks, and up-to-date resources using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure that feedback is contextually relevant and accurate. By using RAG, it can draw from a wide range of educational content to enhance its guidance.
- **Bias Mitigation and Transparency:** The system would be designed with fairness and transparency in mind, using anonymised data and ensuring grading is unbiased. Explainability features would allow teachers and students to review why a specific grade or feedback was given, making the process more accountable and keeping a 'human in the loop'.

### **Impact**
The impact of this solution could be transformative, both in terms of educational outcomes and efficiency:

#### **Time Savings**
- Teachers typically spend between 6-8 hours a week on grading for each course, depending on class sise. With an AI system automating this, teachers could save up to 80% of this time—about 5-6 hours per week.
- If we consider a school with 20 teachers, each responsible for grading 100 students, the total time saved in a year could be as high as 1,000 hours per teacher. This translates to hundreds of thousands of hours saved across the education system.

#### **Student Engagement and Fairness**
- **Faster Learning:** Students can interact with the AI for immediate feedback and clarification, allowing them to learn at their own pace. Studies show that personalised, timely feedback can improve learning outcomes by up to 30% (source: National Education Association).
- **Bias Reduction:** By removing the subjectivity of human grading, the AI ensures a fairer system for all students, which is particularly important in diverse educational environments.

#### **The Customer Value and Experience Offering **
- **Data-Driven Insights for Teachers:**
  - The AI would collect data on student performance, allowing teachers to identify trends and gaps in class-wide performance. This data would help teachers make informed decisions about the most effective strategies for individual or group instruction. The AI-generated customized lesson plans would allow teachers to efficiently address class needs without reinventing the wheel.
- Personalized Learning for Students:**
  -Students would receive feedback tailored to their individual work, promoting a deeper understanding of how to improve and what steps to take to reach higher academic levels. They would have 24/7 access to the AI for clarification and learning support.

### **Business Plan**
The business model would involve a subscription-based SaaS platform for schools, universities, and online learning institutions. The pricing could be tiered based on student enrollment, with discounts for large institutions or district-wide adoption. A freemium model could also be considered for smaller institutions to drive adoption and allow for a broad user base. Additional revenue streams could include providing premium features for teachers, such as deeper analytics, detailed student progress reports, and teacher training on AI integration.
