### **Step 1: Define the Scope**
This solution focuses on **secondary and tertiary education** where:
1. Grading workload is a significant portion of teacher duties.
2. Automated feedback and grading solutions can have measurable benefits.

We exclude **primary education**, as grading there is less structured and often qualitative rather than quantitative.

### **Step 2: Key UK Education Statistics**
- **Secondary education**: ~3.5 million students in UK secondary schools.  
- **Tertiary education**: ~2.3 million students enrolled in universities in the UK.  
  **Total relevant students**: \(3.5M + 2.3M = 5.8M\).

- **Number of teachers**:
  - Secondary school teachers: ~250,000.
  - University academic staff (teaching): ~200,000.
  **Total relevant teachers**: \(250,000 + 200,000 = 450,000\).

---

### **Step 3: Teacher Time Spent on Grading**
#### **Assumptions**:
1. Teachers work ~39 weeks per year (taking school holidays into account).  
2. A standard workweek is ~37.5 hours/week.  
3. Teachers typically spend ~10% of their time on grading and feedback.  

#### **Calculations**:
- **Annual working hours per teacher**:
  \[
  39 \, \text{weeks/year} \times 37.5 \, \text{hours/week} = 1,462.5 \, \text{hours/year}.
  \]
- **Time spent grading (10%)**:
  \[
  1,462.5 \times 0.10 = 146.25 \, \text{hours/year per teacher}.
  \]
- **Total grading hours across all relevant teachers**:
  \[
  450,000 \, \text{teachers} \times 146.25 \, \text{hours/year} = 65.81 \, \text{million hours/year}.
  \]

---

### **Step 4: Monetary Value of Teacher Time**
#### **Assumptions**:
- Average teacher salary in the UK: ~£30,000/year.
- Hourly wage (based on 37.5 hours/week, 39 weeks/year):
  \[
  \frac{£30,000}{1,462.5 \, \text{hours/year}} = £20.52 \, \text{per hour}.
  \]

#### **Total monetary value of grading time**:
\[
65.81 \, \text{million hours/year} \times £20.52 = £1.35 \, \text{billion/year}.
\]

---

### **Step 5: Cost of the AI Solution**
#### **Initial Development Cost**:
- Developing an AI system (including NLP, machine learning, and agentic AI capabilities): **£500,000 to £2 million**. We'll assume **£1.5 million** for this calculation.

#### **Annual Operational Costs**:
- Cloud hosting, updates, and ongoing improvements: ~**£200,000/year**.

#### **First-year total cost**:
\[
£1.5 \, \text{million} + £200,000 = £1.7 \, \text{million}.
\]

---

### **Step 6: Total Addressable Market (TAM)**
#### **Relevant Population**:
- **Students** in secondary and tertiary education: 5.8 million.
- Assume ~10% adoption of the solution within the first 5 years (conservative estimate):
  \[
  5.8 \, \text{million students} \times 0.10 = 580,000 \, \text{students}.
  \]

#### **Monetary TAM**:
If the solution charges schools/universities £50/year per student (reasonable licensing fee):
\[
580,000 \, \text{students} \times £50 = £29 \, \text{million/year TAM}.
\]

---

### **Step 7: ROI of the Solution**
- **Annual teacher time saved**: £1.35 billion/year.  
- **Annual cost of solution (after development)**: £200,000/year.  
- **ROI**:  
  \[
  \frac{\text{Value of time saved}}{\text{Cost of solution}} = \frac{£1.35 \, \text{billion}}{£200,000} \approx 6,750\% \, \text{ROI}.
  \]

---

### **Summary of Key Metrics**:
- **TAM**: £29 million/year (based on 580,000 students).  
- **Cost of solution (first year)**: £1.7 million.  
- **Teacher time saved**: £1.35 billion/year.  
- **ROI**: ~6,750%.
