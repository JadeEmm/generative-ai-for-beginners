    "# Introduction to Prompt Engineering\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing prompts for natural language processing tasks. It involves selecting the right prompts, tuning their parameters, and evaluating their performance. Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving high accuracy and efficiency in NLP models. In this section, we will explore the basics of prompt engineering using the OpenAI models for exploration."

      "\n",
      "#### **1. Introduction (10 min)**\n",
      "**Discussion Prompt & Warm-Up Questions:**  \n",
      "- Begin by asking the class: “What do you think life on Mars will be like by the year 2076?”  \n",
      "- Build excitement: “Imagine a world where humanity has colonized Mars. What kinds of challenges would arise? Now, imagine one of the greatest challenges: war.”  \n",
      "\n",
      "Give students 2-3 minutes to brainstorm individually. Then, ask a few students to share some ideas with the class. On the board, jot down major themes (e.g., resources, politics, lack of communication, cultural differences between Mars and Earth).  \n",

      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **2. Mini-Lecture: Setting the Scene (10 min)**  \n",
      "Provide background for the Martian War of 2076. This can include both speculative \"facts\" (to excite creativity) and fictional details:  \n",
      "- By the mid-21st century, humans successfully colonized Mars and established megacities under domes.  \n",
      "- As Earth's resources dwindled, governmental tensions between Mars colonies and Earth escalated. Martians demanded independence, but Earth viewed Mars as a vital source of minerals and water.  \n",
      "- The war began in 2076 after a major incident (e.g., Earth hackers disabled a Martian water reclamation system, or Martians refused to pay resource taxes to Earth’s government).  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Themes to Highlight:**  \n",
      "- Exploration of autonomy vs. control  \n",
      "- War over resources (scarcity breeds conflict)  \n",
      "- The role of technology in warfare  \n",

      "#### **3. Class Activity: Building the Narrative (25 min)**  \n",
      "**Step 1: Group Brainstorming (10 min)**  \n",
      "Divide students into groups of 4–5. Each group will brainstorm different aspects of the war, using the following guiding questions (provide handouts):  \n",
      "- What was the spark that started the war?  \n",
      "- Who were the key players on both sides? (Martian rebel leaders, Earth’s political/military figures, etc.)  \n",
      "- What types of futuristic technology were used in the war? (e.g., drones, AI-controlled fleets, bio-engineered soldiers, space combat ships)  \n",
      "- What were the consequences of the war? (Did Mars win its independence? Did Earth reassert dominance? Were there peace treaties?)  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 2: Creative Writing/Drawing (15 min)**  \n",
      "- Have each group focus on creating a short narrative or visual representation (e.g., a propaganda poster, map of the conflict, or timeline). Encourage each student to take on a role or perspective (e.g., a Martian miner turned freedom fighter, an Earth general overseeing the war effort, or a civilian caught in the conflict).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Optional Challenge: Groups can write a \"news article\" from 2076 covering a key battle or turning point in the war.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **4. Sharing and Reflection (10 min)**  \n",
      "- Each group presents its narrative, timeline, or visual aid to the class.  \n",
      "- As a class, discuss patterns and themes: Were there similarities in the causes of the war? How do these hypothetical events mirror real historical conflicts?  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Teacher-Led Reflection Questions:**  \n",
      "- “What does this imagined war teach us about current conflicts on Earth?”  \n",
      "- “Can speculative fiction help us think differently about humanity’s future, especially as we expand into space?”  \n",

      "---\n",
